# Set Game Project Documentation

## Project Overview
A comprehensive web-based implementation of the Set card game built with React and TypeScript, featuring advanced timer controls and complete performance tracking. Personalized for Chace with beautiful design and engaging gameplay.

## Architecture

### Game Logic (`src/game/`)
- **deck.ts**: Card generation and shuffling logic (81 unique cards)
- **setValidation.ts**: Core Set validation algorithm with comprehensive rules
- **gameLogic.ts**: Enhanced game state management, timer controls, and result tracking

### Components (`src/components/`)
- **Game.tsx**: Main game container with navigation between game and scoreboard
- **GameBoard.tsx**: Responsive grid layout for displaying cards
- **Card.tsx**: Individual card component with SVG shapes and stable IDs
- **GameStats.tsx**: Enhanced controls including timer pause/resume and scoreboard access
- **Scoreboard.tsx**: Comprehensive performance tracking and analytics

### Types (`src/types/`)
- **game.ts**: TypeScript interfaces for cards, game state, and timer system
- **scoreboard.ts**: Complete type definitions for performance tracking

### Utils (`src/utils/`)
- **localStorage.ts**: Robust data persistence with versioning and migration support

## Major Features Implemented

### üéÆ Core Game Features

### üèÜ Comprehensive Scoreboard
1. **Automatic Result Tracking**: Every game saved with detailed metrics
2. **Sortable Performance Data**: By score, time, date, hints used
3. **Personal Records System**: Fastest times, highest scores, perfect games
4. **Statistics Dashboard**: Comprehensive analytics and averages
5. **Search and Filtering**: Easy game history navigation
6. **Achievement Highlighting**: Visual recognition of personal bests

### üé® Enhanced Design
1. **Responsive Layout**: Perfect on all device sizes
2. **SVG Card Graphics**: Crisp, scalable shapes with stable rendering
3. **Purple Theme**: Elegant personalized color scheme for Chace
4. **Smooth Animations**: Card interactions and state transitions
5. **Accessibility Features**: Clear visual feedback and intuitive controls

## Technical Improvements
