# Set Game Project Documentation

## Project Overview
A web-based implementation of the Set card game built with React and TypeScript, personalized for Chace.

## Architecture

### Game Logic (`src/game/`)
- **deck.ts**: Card generation and shuffling logic
- **setValidation.ts**: Core Set validation algorithm
- **gameLogic.ts**: Game state management and gameplay mechanics

### Components (`src/components/`)
- **Game.tsx**: Main game container and state management
- **GameBoard.tsx**: Grid layout for displaying cards
- **Card.tsx**: Individual card component with SVG shapes
- **GameStats.tsx**: Score display, timer, and game controls

### Types (`src/types/`)
- **game.ts**: TypeScript interfaces for cards and game state

## Key Features Implemented
1. **Set Validation**: Checks if 3 cards form a valid set (all same or all different for each feature)
2. **Dynamic Board**: Starts with 12 cards, can add 3 more when needed
3. **Hint System**: Shows valid sets when requested (limited to 3 hints per game)
4. **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
5. **Personalization**: Welcome message for Chace

## Development Notes
- Using Vite for fast development and hot module replacement
- Tailwind CSS for responsive styling
- SVG shapes are generated dynamically based on card properties
- Game state is managed with React hooks

## Testing
Run `npm run dev` to start the development server on http://localhost:5173

## Future Enhancements
- Multiplayer mode
- Score persistence
- Sound effects
- Animation improvements
- Difficulty levels
